the use of digital signature  represents the natural progression of service dematerialization within companies . with remote work being widespread in this day and age and the increasing adoption of digital solutions , digital signatures have become a rising necessity for document authentication . in the same concept the use of electronic invoicing is now 
a standard practice in the business world . in this vision of dematerialization , and enhancement of data precision , we aim to set up a
digital signature system as well as an OCR software  to generate standardized  electronic invoices. 

________________________________________________________________


the main goal we want to achieve through this project is creating a innovative and efficient web application that will allow processing electronic documents together with a secure digital signature system. 
the said application will aim to simplify and expedite the document management procedure within the company , while providing advanced 
features for precessing , storage and electronic signature .

digital signature is an authentication procedure which garentees the integrity of an electronic document . It is mainly based on the use of asymmetric encryption techniques , such as RSA to link the author of a document to its content uniquely . when a doument is electronically signed , a digital fingerprint is generated from its content and encrypted with the signer's private key . the said fingerprint , once implemented in the document , can be verified by any entity using the public key to ensure
that the document has not been altered and is indeed coming from the claimed person . 
thus digital signature is a dependable document authentication method that esures their integrity in the digital world .

why RSA?
it is a asymmetric encryption system created by Ron Rivest , adi shamir and leonard adleman. it is widely used due to its simplicity and efficiency. its functionality is based on a pair of keys : a public key which can be used by anyone to encrypt a message and a private key to decrypt that same message .thus the RSA algorithm ensures the authencity and integrity of an electronical document 
among the numerous advantages of RSA
security : the algorithm is hard to break if you dont have the private key 
authentication: it allows the user to identify the sender 
integrity: once signed , it is practically impossible to modify the content of the document without the attempt being detected . 
interoperability: the algorithm is widely adopted and supported by numerous applications and communication protocols .
